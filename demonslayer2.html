  <h2><i><strong>Tanjiro Kamado (Japanese: 竈門 炭治郎, Hepburn: Kamado Tanjirō) is a fictional character and the protagonist of Koyoharu Gotouge's manga Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba. Tanjiro goes on a quest to restore the humanity of his sister, Nezuko, who was turned into a demon after his family was killed by Muzan Kibutsuji following an attack that resulted in the death of his other relatives. After an encounter with Giyu Tomioka, a demon slayer, Tanjiro is recruited by Giyu to also become a demon slayer to help his sister turn human again and avenge his family. Besides Ufotable's Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba anime adaptation, Tanjiro has also appeared in a light novel that acts as a prequel to the manga.

    Gotouge created Tanjiro following a suggestion from their editor of having a bright main character who would stand out in his dark narrative. His design was influenced by Himura Kenshin from Nobuhiro Watsuki's manga Rurouni Kenshin when deciding how androgynous the character should look. The character is primarily voiced by Natsuki Hanae in Japanese and Zach Aguilar in English.
    
    The character has been well received by manga and anime critics due to his caring nature and relationship with his sister while also becoming a strong fighter. This has led to the character winning multiple awards with Hanae's performance as him also receiving one. Aguilar's performance was also well-received.</strong></i></h2>

 <h2><strong><i>Nezuko Kamado (Japanese: 竈門 禰豆子, Hepburn: Kamado Nezuko) is a fictional character in Koyoharu Gotouge's manga series Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba. Nezuko and her older brother Tanjiro Kamado are the sole survivors of an incident through which they lost their entire family due to the Demon King, Muzan Kibutsuji, with Nezuko being transformed into a demon, but unexpectedly still showing signs of human emotion and thought. After an encounter with Giyu Tomioka, a demon slayer, Tanjiro begins his quest to help his sister turn back into a human and avenge the death of his family.

    Nezuko's character was created to make Tanjiro's character more complex, as he struggles to reconcile with his sister being a demon.[2] Critical response to Nezuko has been positive due to how unconventional it was for the narrative to have her kind of character as a demon, as well as how her fighting abilities adapt and grow as the series progresses.
    
    She has also been a very popular character within the Demon Slayer fanbase, appearing in an issue from the Weekly Playboy magazine.</i></strong></h2>

An extremely cowardly boy who was forced to join the Demon Slayer Corps at around the same time as Tanjiro to pay for his debts, Zenitsu Agatsuma (我妻 善逸, Agatsuma Zen'itsu) sometimes functions as comic relief. His cowardly personality is also used to contrast with Tanjiro's determined character. Zenitsu trained in the "Thunder Breathing" (雷の呼吸, Kaminari no kokyū) style by the former Thunder Hashira but was only able to learn the first form, and because of this he often belittles himself, despite the fact that he is talented. He joins up with Tanjiro on a mission and since then, he has tagged along with him, partially out of his infatuation with Nezuko, but also due to recognizing how honest and kind he is. His cowardly personality initially hinders him and he is only able to fight when he is unconscious or asleep, but he later learns to push his fears aside and take action when needed, to the point of developing a new, exclusive Thunder Breathing form. Zenitsu's sword is colored yellow and has a lightning bolt design. He has a heightened sense of hearing which allows him to distinguish a person's true character by the sound of their heartbeat and track demons.

        A young boy who was raised by his mother Kotoha for a short time until she was murdered by a demon, later revealed as Upper Rank Two, Doma of the Twelve Kizuki. After she sacrificed herself to save his life, he was raised by wild boars, and then taught to talk by an old man. Inosuke Hashibira (嘴平 伊之助, Hashibira Inosuke) uses a self-taught style called "Beast Breathing" (獣の呼吸, Kedamono no kokyū), along with two serrated swords in battle. When he gets new swords, he purposely chips them in order to match his preference and fighting style (much to his swordsmith's anger). Like Zenitsu, Inosuke is occasional comic relief for the series. He is portrayed as brash and prone to reacting violently, and while he appears dim, he proves himself in battle time after time. He is drawn as extremely muscular and rugged, which contrasts with his oddly effeminate face, which he normally hides under a boar's head mask. This mask was made from the head of his deceased boar mother, and he wears it in memory of her. When Inosuke first meets Tanjiro, he treats him as an enemy, but they quickly become friends as they fight together. He often challenges Tanjiro to competitions that are accepted in good spirits. He took the Demon Slayer Corps test at the same time as Tanjiro and Zenitsu and, unknown to most, became the first to clear it. Inosuke's swords are colored indigo gray. He has a heightened sense of touch, being able to locate enemies by feeling the vibrations in the air. Inosuke cannot read or write, and often forgets names or gets them completely wrong.</i>
